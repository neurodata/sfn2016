##### Cloud in a Box
- our big appeal to neuroscientists is the following: we build tools that make processing and storing your data in the cloud easy. The NUC plan worked ok last time, but if we're going to do more hacking we should step up our locally available resources.
- Bring N relatively high performance systems, networked and running the full stack. Simulate AWS as close as possible. Have plenty of storage so we can ingest data onsite.
- As fall gets closer, start ramping up efforts to make SFN attendees aware that they can bring their data and have us ingest it / play with it. Hack projects for the CS side can be adding user features on the spot (e.g. brightness and contrast to NeuroDataViz). Having a code base that is stable and modular enough to allow feature adds would great, regardless.

##### Hack Space
- People like having a place to put their laptop that isn't their lap (I think)
- People also like couches
- People like coffee! Coffee bar with space for hacking?
- People like external monitors.

#####Others??
- bi-daily workshops
- hack-off contests for prizes
