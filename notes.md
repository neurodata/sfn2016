## Summary from this year at SfN

### Pros (i.e. do again):
- stickers + reprints; people like free things.
- monitors for interacting with sic or ndviz or meda; people like interactive things.
- booth size does matter.
- having booth sections was cool (though can be adjusted as seen below).
- shirts were cool to give to collaborators and funders and friends.
- business cards were helpful, though adding website would help more.

### Cons (i.e. improve):
- banner should be all 30'x8' of the backdrop
- we should display logos on the larger banner for groups that we are a part of/affiliated with (jhu, icm, kndi, cis, etc.), and a section of smaller logos that are our friends. This will clear up confusion from people asking if we're ndwb.
- demos. we should have mandatory internal training for those planning to man/woman/staff the booth in which they will learn about each of the services we provide and practice giving demos. I imagine this happening in three phases: introduction (in which we teach them things from the demo slides), demo introduction (in which we demonstrate the demos for them), and practice (in which we split into two groups and have everyone cycle around presenting each of the demos to everyone else).
- booth should have hacking on one end, and then just the couch section extending the remaining 2 panels. This way we still get to have  hack space, but it doesn't break up all of our seating making the 1 booth feel like 3.
- sticker should have higher contrast between text and background (my bad, sorry).
- shirts should also be purchased in womens' sizes.
- we should make sure to give more credit to those who help us finance and support the booth.
- we should organize and throw an official party.
- we should get ugrads down to DC to staff the booth.
