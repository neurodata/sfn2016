## Summary from this year at SfN

### Pros (i.e. do again):
- stickers + reprints; people like free things
- monitors for interacting with sic or ndviz or meda; people like interactive things
- booth size does matter
- having booth sections was cool (though can be adjusted as seen below)
- shirts were cool
- business cards were helpful, though adding website would help.

### Cons (i.e. improve):
- banner should be all 30'x10'
- we should display on the larger banner logos for groups that we are a part of/affiliated with, and a section of smaller logos that are our friends. This will clear up confusion from people asking if we're ndwb
- demos. we should have a hard deadline for demos about 2 weeks out of the conference by which point if you've not successfully run your demo to the group and had another member of our team run it, we don't do that demo at the conference. This will prevent awkwardly promising to show non-functioning stuff.
- booth should have hacking on one end, and then just the couch section extending the rest of the 2 panels. This way we still get to have  hack space, but it doesn't break up all of our seating making the booth feel like 3.
- sticker should have higher contrast between website and background
